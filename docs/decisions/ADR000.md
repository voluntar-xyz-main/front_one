title: "ADR000: Architecture for Early-Stage"
description: Initial architectural decisions balancing MVP delivery with contributor-friendly extensibility
status: active
---

## Context

We're initiating an open-source volunteer opportunity aggregator with:

- Uncertain long-term requirements (evolving NGO integrations)
- Need for rapid MVP development to validate core concepts
- Requirement to attract external contributors with varied expertise
- Potential for significant pivots based on early user feedback

Key tensions:

1. Speed vs. Structure: Balancing quick delivery with long-term maintainability
2. Flexibility vs. Consistency: Enabling experimentation while maintaining contributor sanity
3. Minimalism vs. Documentation: Providing enough guidance without over-engineering
4. Temporary vs Permanent: Clarity that current solution is transitional

## Decision

We will adopt the following foundational principles:

**1. Layered Isolation Architecture**

```text
src/
├── data/         # data management (API clients, DB interactions, hooks)
├── components/   # Presentational UI (Dumb components)
├── layouts/      # App-wide visual scaffolding
```

**2. MVP-Driven Iteration**

- Core focus on 2 flows:
  1. Opportunity search/filter/browsing
  2. User accounts and own collection management

**3. No admin UI**

- until 3 NGO integrations are operational, we will not implement organization/jobs/collection mgmt ui
- the data will be batch seeded from yaml files

## Validity

This decision remains valid until:

- MVP launch (v0.5 release)
- OR major pivot requiring >40% codebase rewrite
- OR Consistent contributor activity (>5 active contributors/week) for 1 month
- OR Project receives >50 stars (indicator of community interest)
- OR 6 months from project inception

Whichever comes first. To be reviewed.

## Consequences

### Positive

- ✅ New contributors can focus on isolated layers (e.g., UI-only contributions)
- ✅ Easier experimentation
- ✅ Avoid UI lock-in before understanding user needs

### Negative

- ⚠️ Potential need for architectural refactoring at MVP stage
- ⚠️ Manual data operations increase maintenance

### Neutral

- ➖ TypeScript adoption requires contributor onboarding
- ➖ Layered structure may feel heavyweight for simple prototypes
